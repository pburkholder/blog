# Welcome to pburkholder blog drafts and works-in-progress

I use Tumblr as my blogging platform. 

It's a complete tech-weenie cop-out, but I tried it out for S&Gs a couple of years ago when I was feeling cheap. Every now and again I'm tempted to replace it with something more _serious_ like Jekyll or Octopress or DocPad, but I have bigger fish to fry than what blogging platform I use.

That said, I don't edit in Tumblr. I do my work here, and what's unpublished in this repo is less-filtered, more-opinionated, and often utterly unresearched.  Please have a grain or two of salt on hand if you choose to read further.

Regards,

Peter Burkholder
